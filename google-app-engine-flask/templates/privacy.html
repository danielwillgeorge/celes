	<p>We use cookies to remember your preferences and track advertisements. For these reasons, it is necessary that you enable cookies in your 
	browser, and you hereby acknowledge that we have informed you of our use of cookies and that you consent to our use of cookies 
	in relation to your computer system.</p>

	<h2>Third Party Websites</h2>

	<p>Sheepdog may post links to third party websites on its Site. These third party websites are not screened for privacy or security issues by Sheepdog, 
	and you release us from any liability for the conduct of these third party websites.</p>

	<p>Please be aware that this Privacy Policy, and any other policies in place, in addition to any amendments, does not create rights enforceable 
	by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to members of the Service or Site. Sheepdog bears no responsibility 
	for the information collected or used by any advertiser or third party website. Please review the privacy policy and terms of service for each 
	site you visit through third party links.</p>

	<h2>Third Party Access to Your Information</h2>

	<p>Although you are entering into an Agreement with Sheepdog to disclose your information to us, we do use third party individuals and organizations 
	to assist us, including contractors, web hosts, and others.</p>

	<p>Throughout the course of our provision of our Service to you, we may delegate our authority to collect, access, use, and disseminate your 
	information. For example, our web host stores the information that you provide us, and we may hire outside contractors to perform maintenance 
	or assist us in securing our website.</p>

	<p>It is therefore necessary that you grant the third parties we may use in the course of our business the same rights that you afford us under 
	this Privacy Policy. For this reason, you hereby agree that for every authorization which you grant to us in this Privacy Policy, 
	you also grant to any third party that we may hire, contract, or otherwise retain the services of for the purpose of operating, 
	maintaining, repairing, or otherwise improving or preserving our website or its underlying files or systems. You agree not to hold us liable 
	for the actions of any of these third parties, even if we would normally be held vicariously liable for their actions, and that you must take 
	legal action against them directly should they commit any tort or other actionable wrong against you.</p>

	<h2>Release of Your Information for Legal Purposes</h2>

	<p>At times it may become necessary or desirable to Sheepdog, for legal purposes, to release your information in response to a request from a government
 	agency or a private litigant. You agree that we may disclose your information to a third party where we believe, 
 	in good faith, that it is desirable to do so for the purposes of a civil action, criminal investigation, or other legal matter. 
 	In the event that we receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we may elect to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion to 
 	quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either. We may also proactively report you, 
 	and release your information to, third parties where we believe that it is prudent to do so for legal reasons, such as our belief that you 
 	have engaged in fraudulent activities. You release us from any damages that may arise from or relate to the release of your information to 
 	a request from law enforcement agencies or private litigants.</p>

	<h2>Commercial and Non-Commercial Communications</h2>

	<p>By providing information to the Site that forms the basis of communications with you, such as contact information, you waive all rights to 
	file complaints concerning unsolicited e-mails from Sheepdog since, by providing such information, you agree to receive communications 
	from us or anyone else covered under this Privacy Policy. However, you may unsubscribe from certain communications by notifying Sheepdog 
	that you no longer wish to receive solicitations or information and we will endeavor to remove you from the database.</p>

	<h2>Security Measures</h2>

	<p>We take certain measures to enhance the security of our Site and Service, including using SSL certificates. However, we make no
 	representations as to the security or privacy of your information. It is in our interest to keep our website secure, but we 
 	recommend that you use anti-virus software, firewalls, and other precautions to protect yourself from security threats.</p>

	<h2>Your California Online Privacy Rights</h2>

	<p>Sheepdog permits residents of the State of California to use its Service. Therefore, it is the intent of Sheepdog to comply with the 
	California Business and Professions Code §§ 22575-22579. If you are a California resident you may request certain information 
	regarding our disclosure of personal information to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Various provisions 
	throughout this Privacy Policy address requirements of the Californian privacy statutes. In summary, you must presume that we 
	collect electronic information from all visitors. You may contact us at contact@yapme.co with any questions.</p>

	<h2>International Transfer</h2>

	<p>Your information may be transferred to—and maintained on—computers located outside of your state, province, country or other 
	governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.</p>

	<h2>Amendments</h2>

	<p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we amend this Privacy Policy, we will update this page accordingly 
	and require you to accept the amendments in order for you to be able to continue using our Service.</p>
